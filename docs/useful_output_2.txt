Exactly! You've grasped a crucial concept in financial machine learning. Let's expand on this:

1. **Price Scale Independence**
```python
# At $10,000:
ema9 = 10000
ema21 = 9900
diff = 100  # +100 difference

# At $50,000:
ema9 = 50000
ema21 = 49900
diff = 100  # Same +100 difference, but very different context!
```

Better approach would be:
```python
# Percentage changes or returns
price_pct_change = df['close'].pct_change()
ema9_pct_change = df['ema_9'].pct_change()
ema21_pct_change = df['ema_21'].pct_change()

# Relative strength (how much faster/slower one EMA moves vs another)
ema_relative = ema9_pct_change / ema21_pct_change

# Or normalized price levels
df['price_to_ema21'] = df['close'] / df['ema_21'] - 1  # % distance from EMA
```

2. **Context Matters**
```python
# Price context features
df['atr_pct'] = df['atr'] / df['close']  # Volatility relative to price level
df['volume_sma'] = df['volume'].rolling(20).mean()
df['volume_relative'] = df['volume'] / df['volume_sma']  # Volume spike detection
```

3. **Combining Scale-Independent Features**
```python
features = {
    'trend': [
        'close_pct_change',          # Price momentum
        'price_to_ema21',           # Trend position
        'ema_relative'              # Trend strength
    ],
    'volume': [
        'volume_relative',          # Volume spikes
        'obv_pct_change'           # Money flow
    ],
    'volatility': [
        'atr_pct'                  # Normalized volatility
    ]
}
```

This way:
- Model learns patterns that work across different price levels
- Features capture relative movements and relationships
- Still maintains important context about market conditions
- More robust to major price changes or market regimes

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or show how to implement them with your specific indicators?
