Reinforcement learning.
1 min timestamp
10 to 1 candles for train-test
10 to 1 candles for prediction
Probably it will be a few ML models for the different types of market 
(also it will choose the right model before using it)

Every 1000 seconds (also it possilby be not a 1 min candles) need to download a csv of candles, 
then analyzer will choose correct strategy for the next actions)

Probably it will be different indicator for different timeframes, 
as example, Firstly model will check RSI indicator for daily timeframe,
then based on this data will check different indicators



LSTMs or GRUs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem if you take to many historical points. The tricks that help build very deep CNNs don't work with RNNs. There is a performance trade off. My models stick to 10-15 day historical input. Experiment with Attention Models. It improves performance drastically. Experiment with different losses, maybe dynamic time warping or something. A lot of stuff to lool at.
