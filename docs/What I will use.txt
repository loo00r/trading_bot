Probably it will be a few ML models for the different types of market 
(also it will choose the right model before using it)

Every 1000 seconds (also it possilby be not a 1 min candles) need to download a csv of candles, 
then analyzer will choose correct strategy for the next actions)

Probably it will be different indicator for different timeframes, 
as example, Firstly model will check RSI indicator for daily timeframe,
then based on this data will check different indicators
