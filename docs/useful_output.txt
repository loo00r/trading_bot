Let's think about this analytically:

Original EMAs vs Difference:

1. **Using Both EMAs:**
```python
df['ema_9'] = ta.ema(df['close'], 9)
df['ema_21'] = ta.ema(df['close'], 21)
```
Pros:
- Model sees absolute price levels through both EMAs
- Can learn patterns from each EMA independently
- More information about actual price movement

2. **Using Only Difference:**
```python
df['ema_diff'] = df['ema_9'] - df['ema_21']
```
Pros:
- Directly captures crossover signals
- Reduces feature dimensionality

Cons (and this is important):
- Loses absolute price level information
- Model only sees relative movement between EMAs
- Can't reconstruct the original trend information

You're right - using only the difference might be losing valuable information. Here's a better approach:

```python
# Keep the longer EMA for trend
df['ema_21'] = ta.ema(df['close'], 21)

# Add difference as additional feature, not replacement
df['ema_diff'] = df['ema_9'] - df['ema_21']

# Now model has both trend and crossover information
features = ['ema_21', 'ema_diff']
```

Same concept applies to Ichimoku:
```python
# Don't just use differences
# Keep base signals
df['tenkan_sen'] = ichimoku_visible['ISA_7']
df['kijun_sen'] = ichimoku_visible['ISB_22']

# Add difference as extra feature
df['tenkan_kijun_diff'] = df['tenkan_sen'] - df['kijun_sen']

features = ['tenkan_sen', 'kijun_sen', 'tenkan_kijun_diff']
```

Think of it this way:
- If BTC is at $50,000 and EMAs cross up
- Or if BTC is at $10,000 and EMAs cross up
- The difference alone would look the same in both cases
- But these might be very different trading situations

So you're absolutely right - using only differences would lose crucial information. Better to:
1. Keep primary trend indicators
2. Add differences as supplementary features
3. Let the model learn which combinations are most predictive

Would you like to explore how to combine these features effectively without losing important information?
